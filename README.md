# Employee_Attrition_Prediction_at_Salifort_Motors-A_Data-Driven_Approach
Explore our data-driven analysis on employee attrition at Salifort Motors. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, we predict and uncover the key factors influencing employee departures. Dive into our models, visualizations, and actionable insights to empower HR decisions and foster a satisfied workforce.

# Project Overview
In this project, we leveraged Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to predict employee attrition within Salifort Motors. The analysis was conducted on a comprehensive dataset specific to the company. The models yielded valuable insights, with the Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of 82%, precision of 45%, recall of 25%, and F1 score of 32%. The Random Forest model showcased superior performance, achieving 98% accuracy, 99% precision, 91% recall, and an impressive F1 score of 95%. Notably, both the Decision Tree and Random Forest models identified common key features influencing employee turnover, including satisfaction level, tenure, number of projects, last evaluation, and average monthly hours.

## Business Understanding
Salifort Motors grapples with the critical challenge of employee retention, a concern that can significantly impact recruitment costs, training investments, and operational stability. To address this challenge, the organization aimed to forecast potential employee departures and comprehend the underlying factors contributing to attrition. By discerning patterns and root causes associated with employee exits, Salifort Motors sought to implement proactive measures, enhancing retention rates, reducing costs, and fostering a contented and stable workforce.

This project was meticulously crafted to provide Salifort Motors with precise data-driven insights and predictive models, empowering the company to make well-informed decisions concerning employee retention and engagement strategies.

## Data Understanding
The analysis centered around the "HR_capstone_dataset.csv," encompassing ten columns of self-reported data from employees within a fictional multinational vehicle manufacturing corporation. This dataset, accessible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction), served as the foundation for our analysis, providing rich information for comprehensive exploration.

## Modeling and Evaluation
A Random Forest model was strategically deployed to discern the most influential features determining employee attrition. The resulting plot illuminates the paramount factors guiding employee departures, offering a clear visualization of the model's discernment.
